# What is this space for?
This space is contains the scripts for generating structured representations of Schema.org terms.

In order to generate variants (that is RDF, JSON or CSV versions) of the Schema.org terms, run the following Python scripts in the `scrapers` directory:

    scrape_rdf.py
    scrape_json.py
    scrape_csv.py

They either write to STDOUT or to a filename taken as command line argument.

There is also a script that generates all formats, does a bit of sanity checking to see if it worked, and copies them to a target directory.

    cd scrapers
    ./run.rb temp-directory target-directory

This requires the [any23](http://developers.any23.org/) command line tool on the path.
